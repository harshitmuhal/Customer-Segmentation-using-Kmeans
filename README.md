# Customer-Segmentation-using-Kmeans
Companies want to know what kind of products to make and what type of customers to target their product towards,while customers want to get better products for their needs.This need is solved by customer segmentation. By using machine learning ,customers can be segmented into different categoires depending upon their income and expenditure as this will place the customers with similar behaviour in the same segment.This will help the companies decide what type of customers they want their prodcuts to be targetted towards and estimate the success of their products .This will also help them make better products for the said segments.Using K means we can cluster the customers in different segments and the visualization of this clustering helps in determining the size and posistion of the classes. This technique may also be used in other areas.
